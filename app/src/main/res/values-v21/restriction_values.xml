  <string name="AllowedDomainsForAppsTitle">Define domains allowed to access G Suite</string>
  <string name="AllowedDomainsForAppsDesc">Enables Chromium\'s restricted log in feature in G Suite and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you define this setting, the user will only be able to access Google
Apps using accounts from the specified domains (note that this does not
work for gmail.com/googlemail.com).

This setting will NOT prevent the user from loging in on a managed device
that requires Google authentication. The user will still be allowed to
sign in to accounts from other domains, but they will receive an error
when trying to use G Suite with those accounts.

If you leave this setting empty/not-configured, the user will be able to
access G Suite with any account.

This policy causes the X-GoogApps-Allowed-Domains header to be appended to
all HTTP and HTTPS requests to all google.com domains, as described in
https://support.google.com/a/answer/1668854.

Users cannot change or override this setting.</string>
  <string name="AlternateErrorPagesEnabledTitle">Enable alternate error pages</string>
  <string name="AlternateErrorPagesEnabledDesc">Enables the use of alternate error pages that are built into Chromium (such as \'page not found\') and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you enable this setting, alternate error pages are used.

If you disable this setting, alternate error pages are never used.

If you enable or disable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Chromium.

If this policy is left not set, this will be enabled but the user will be able to change it.</string>

  <string name="AuthAndroidNegotiateAccountTypeDesc">Specifies the account type of the accounts provided by the Android authentication app that supports HTTP Negotiate authentication (e.g. Kerberos authentication). This information should be available from the supplier of the authentication app. For more details see https://goo.gl/hajyfN.

If no setting is provided, HTTP Negotiate authentication is disabled on Android.</string>
  <string name="AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelistTitle">Kerberos delegation server whitelist</string>
  <string name="AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelistDesc">Servers that Chromium may delegate to.

Separate multiple server names with commas. Wildcards (*) are allowed.

If you leave this policy not set Chromium will not delegate user credentials even if a server is detected as Intranet.</string>
  <string name="AuthSchemesTitle">Supported authentication schemes</string>
  <string name="AuthSchemesDesc">Specifies which HTTP authentication schemes are supported by Chromium.

Possible values are \'basic\', \'digest\', \'ntlm\' and \'negotiate\'. Separate multiple values with commas.

If this policy is left not set, all four schemes will be used.</string>
  <string name="AuthServerWhitelistTitle">Authentication server whitelist</string>
  <string name="AuthServerWhitelistDesc">Specifies which servers should be whitelisted for integrated authentication. Integrated authentication is only enabled when Chromium receives an authentication challenge from a proxy or from a server which is in this permitted list.

Separate multiple server names with commas. Wildcards (*) are allowed.

If you leave this policy not set Chromium will try to detect if a server is on the Intranet and only then will it respond to IWA requests.  If a server is detected as Internet then IWA requests from it will be ignored by Chromium.</string>
  <string name="AutoFillEnabledTitle">Enable AutoFill</string>
  <string name="AutoFillEnabledDesc">Enables Chromium\'s AutoFill feature and allows users to auto complete web forms using previously stored information such as address or credit card information.

If you disable this setting, AutoFill will be inaccessible to users.

If you enable this setting or do not set a value, AutoFill will remain under the control of the user. This will allow them to configure AutoFill profiles and to switch AutoFill on or off at their own discretion.</string>
  <string name="AutofillCreditCardEnabledTitle">Enable AutoFill for credit cards</string>
  <string name="AutofillCreditCardEnabledDesc">Enables Chromium\'s AutoFill feature and allows users to auto complete credit card and address information in web forms using previously stored information.

If you disable this setting, Autofill will never suggest, or fill credit card information, nor will it save additional credit card information that the user might submit while browsing the web.

If you enable this setting or do not set a value, then user will be able to control the overall autofill feature (incuding credit cards) in the UI.</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCasTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCasDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
1. The hash is of the server certificate\'s subjectPublicKeyInfo.
2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server\'s certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the \\&quot;/\\&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is \\&quot;sha256\\&quot;.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCasTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCasDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default one or more operating systems supported by Chromium, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or Chromium OS.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the \\&quot;/\\&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is \\&quot;sha256\\&quot;.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsTitle">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of URLs</string>
  <string name="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrlsDesc">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements to the listed URLs.

This policy allows certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs to not be disclosed via Certificate Transparency. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used, but makes it harder to detect misissued certificates for those hosts.

A URL pattern is formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format. However, because certificates are valid for a given hostname independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname portion of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</string>
  <string name="ContextualSearchEnabledTitle">Enable Tap to Search</string>
  <string name="ContextualSearchEnabledDesc">Enables the availability of Tap to Search in Chromium\'s content view.

If you enable this setting, Tap to Search will be available to the user and they can choose to turn the feature on or off.

If you disable this setting, Tap to Search will be disabled completely.

If this policy is left not set, it is equivalent to being enabled, see description above.</string>

  <string name="CookiesSessionOnlyForUrlsDesc">Cookies set by pages matching these URL patterns will be limited to the current session, i.e. they will be deleted when the browser exits.

For URLs not covered by the patterns specified here, or for all URLs if this policy is not set, the global default value will be used either from the \'DefaultCookiesSetting\' policy, if it is set, or the user\'s personal configuration otherwise.

Note that if Chromium is running in \'background mode\', the session may not be closed when the last browser window is closed, but will instead stay active until the browser exits. Please see the \'BackgroundModeEnabled\' policy for more information about configuring this behavior.

See also policies \'CookiesAllowedForUrls\' and \'CookiesBlockedForUrls\'. Note that there must be no conflicting URL patterns between these three policies - it is unspecified which policy takes precedence.

  <string name="IsolateOriginsAndroidTitle">Enable Site Isolation for specified origins on Android devices</string>
  <string name="IsolateOriginsAndroidDesc">
If the policy is enabled, each of the named origins in a
comma-separated list will run in its own process. This will also isolate
origins named by subdomains; e.g. specifying https://example.com/ will
also cause https://foo.example.com/ to be isolated as part of the
https://example.com/ site.
If the policy is disabled, no explicit Site Isolation will happen and field trials of IsolateOriginsAndroid and SitePerProcessAndroid will be disabled. Users will still be able to enable IsolateOrigins manually.
If the policy is not configured, the user will be able to change this setting.

NOTE: On Android, Site Isolation is experimental. Support will improve over time, but currently it may cause performance problems.

NOTE: This policy applies only to Chrome on Android running on devices with strictly more than 1GB of RAM. To apply the policy on non-Android platforms, use IsolateOrigins.

  <string name="ManagedBookmarksTitle">Managed Bookmarks</string>
  <string name="ManagedBookmarksDesc">Configures a list of managed bookmarks.

The policy consists of a list of bookmarks whereas each bookmark is a dictionary containing the keys \\&quot;name\\&quot; and \\&quot;url\\&quot; which hold the bookmark\'s name and its target. A subfolder may be configured by defining a bookmark without an \\&quot;url\\&quot; key but with an additional \\&quot;children\\&quot; key which itself contains a list of bookmarks as defined above (some of which may be folders again). Chromium amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted via the Omnibox, for example \\&quot;google.com\\&quot; becomes \\&quot;https://google.com/\\&quot;.

These bookmarks are placed in a folder that can\'t be modified by the user (but the user can choose to hide it from the bookmark bar). By default the folder name is \\&quot;Managed bookmarks\\&quot; but it can be customized by adding to the list of bookmarks a dictionary containing the key \\&quot;toplevel_name\\&quot; with the desired folder name as the value.

Managed bookmarks are not synced to the user account and can\'t be modified by extensions.</string>
